###This project is obsolete. Try one of these alternatives:

* Nylas N1, an Electron / JS-based, extensible client: https://github.com/nylas/n1
* Mailpile, a Python-based client more-similar to GMail: https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile

## Kite, a modern webmail

Kite is a webmail designed to look a lot like gmail and to be easily deployable on a single server.
It's written in Javascript with Angularjs for the frontend, and in Python 2 for the backend.

This is very much alpha software, but I hope to have something usable in a couple months.

### How to run it

To run it, you'll need to have [vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/) installed.
When it's done, run:

    vagrant up

After this, browse to http://192.168.50.4 . You should be greeted by a login window. Use whatever username/password combination to login.

The host name of the vagrant box is kitebox.dev. You should probably add it to
your (host) machine /etc/hosts.
